Design: This system is designed with the 3-tier architecture, which separates the system's presentation (the GUI), its control logic (the Controller), and its data storage and retrieval (the Model) into separate layers. The system is also designed with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which separates the data (the Model) from its presentation (the View) and its control logic (the Controller). This allows for easier maintenance, testing, and scalability of the system.
